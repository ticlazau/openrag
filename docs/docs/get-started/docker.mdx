To manage your own OpenRAG services, deploy OpenRAG with Docker or Podman.

Use this installation method if you don't want to [use the Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui), or you need to run OpenRAG in an environment where using the TUI is unfeasible.

## Prerequisites

<PartialPrereqCommon />

<PartialPrereqPython />

## Install OpenRAG with Docker Compose

To install OpenRAG with Docker Compose, do the following:

1. Clone the OpenRAG repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag.git
   cd openrag
   ```

2. Install dependencies.
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Copy the example `.env` file included in the repository root.
  The example file includes all environment variables with comments to guide you in finding and setting their values.
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Alternatively, create a new `.env` file in the repository root.
   ```
   touch .env
   ```

4. The Docker Compose files are populated with the values from your `.env` file. 
   The `OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD` value must be set.
   `OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD` can be automatically generated when using the TUI, but for a Docker Compose installation, you can set it manually instead. To generate an OpenSearch admin password, see the [OpenSearch documentation](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/security/configuration/demo-configuration/#setting-up-a-custom-admin-password).

   The following values are optional:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   LANGFLOW_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

   `OPENAI_API_KEY` is optional. You can provide it during [application onboarding](#application-onboarding) or choose a different model provider. If you want to set it in your `.env` file, you can find your OpenAI API key in your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

   `LANGFLOW_SECRET_KEY` is optional. Langflow will auto-generate it if not set. For more information, see the [Langflow documentation](https://docs.langflow.org/api-keys-and-authentication#langflow-secret-key).

   The following Langflow configuration values are optional but important to consider:

   ```env
   LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER=admin
   LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=your_langflow_password
   ```

   `LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER` defaults to `admin`. You can omit it or set it to a different username. `LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` is optional. If omitted, Langflow runs in [autologin mode](https://docs.langflow.org/api-keys-and-authentication#langflow-auto-login) with no password required. If set, Langflow requires password authentication.
   
   For more information on configuring OpenRAG with environment variables, see [Environment variables](/reference/configuration).

5. Start `docling serve` on the host machine.
   OpenRAG Docker installations require that `docling serve` is running on port 5001 on the host machine.
   This enables [Mac MLX](https://opensource.apple.com/projects/mlx/) support for document processing.
   
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/docling_ctl.py start --port 5001
   ```
   
6. Confirm `docling serve` is running.
   ```
   uv run python scripts/docling_ctl.py status
   ```

   Make sure the response shows that `docling serve` is running, for example:
   ```bash
   Status: running
   Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:5001
   Docs: http://127.0.0.1:5001/docs
   PID: 27746
   ```

7. Deploy OpenRAG locally with the appropriate Docker Compose file for your environment.
Both files deploy the same services.

   - [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) is an OpenRAG deployment with GPU support for accelerated AI processing. This Docker Compose file requires an NVIDIA GPU with [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/) support.

      ```bash
      docker compose build
      docker compose up -d
      ```

   - [`docker-compose-cpu.yml`](https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag/blob/main/docker-compose-cpu.yml) is a CPU-only version of OpenRAG for systems without NVIDIA GPU support. Use this Docker Compose file for environments where GPU drivers aren't available.

      ```bash
      docker compose -f docker-compose-cpu.yml up -d
      ```

   <!-- add podman compose -->

   The OpenRAG Docker Compose file starts five containers:
   | Container Name | Default Address | Purpose |
   |---|---|---|
   | OpenRAG Backend | http://localhost:8000 | FastAPI server and core functionality. |
   | OpenRAG Frontend | http://localhost:3000 | React web interface for users. |
   | Langflow | http://localhost:7860 | AI workflow engine and flow management. |
   | OpenSearch | http://localhost:9200 | Vector database for document storage. |
   | OpenSearch Dashboards | http://localhost:5601 | Database administration interface. |

8. Verify installation by confirming all services are running.

   <!-- add podman compose -->
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

   You can now access OpenRAG at the following endpoints:

   - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
   - **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
   - **Langflow**: http://localhost:7860

9. Access the OpenRAG frontend to continue with [application onboarding](#application-onboarding).
